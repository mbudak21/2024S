1) From what I gathered, conceptual art's most defining aspect is that it gives the utmost priority to concepts, and/or ideas rather than the physicality of the object.
It also contrats with physical art, whose ontological status is that the object is physical [wikipedia: physical art]. The reason conceptual art challanges the traditional
notions of art making is that it gives so much priority to the concepts that the object can be very simple, or even able to be constructed by any person with the given
instructions. This notion challenges the traditional norms, because the physicality of the object becomes not unique, i think.

2) Conceptual art is art just like the other forms of art because instead of focusing on the physicality of the object, Conceptual art focuses on concepts and ideas behind
the art. This form of art can seem different because the "art" is not easily viewable, however, if you concentrate on the idea behind it, you may actually understand why
it is deemed as an art form.





6) 
- 1 Try thinking about a certain subject very deeply, and when you feel like you havev a decent idea for an art creation, go for it.
- 2 Get rid of the impulses that sorruound your daily life, and let yourself get bored, very bored.
- 3 Stare at a static object, such as a wall, for 2 hours, or more.
- 4 Do or create something completely random and think about it deeply.
- 5 Do whatever that comes into your mind, adding a stroke in a painting, teaering up the paper, etc. And the look into what you have created.
 
8) I believe seeing requires more intelligent analysis while the act of looking can be simply described as having access to photons that escape the image with one's own eye(s).
We can also think about the cases in which people look but don't see, for example, one can look at one of the pages of a book but not see the meaning behind the words.

9) The definition of kinship differs from people to people. I have friends who don't really get along, or just plainly hate their families, for them, kinship would be
something that includes the notions of hate, anger, lack of love, abandonment, etc. My subjective understanding of kinship is something that is as close to unconditional
love as possible, while also being expressive of a `kins` negative sides.
