# History
## 1940-1950 Birth Of Computation
- 1943 Logical Neuron Model
- 1950 Alan Turing Test
## 1950-1960 Birth Of Ai
- First ideas of ML
- 1956 Darthmouth Meeting, coined the term AI
- 1958 Basic Neuron Model Perceptron

## 1960-1970 Logic vs Connectionism and the First Winter
- 1965 ?
- 1969 Perceptron Book: Death of connectionism
- 1970 Backpropagation algorithm

## 1970-1990 Logic vs Connectionism and the Second Winter
- Explosion of Academic Papers and Pilot Industrial Applications
- Disappointment and the second winter
- Connectionism Rebirth: Backpropagation and advances in multi-layer neural networks (NNs)

## 1990-2005: Statistical Approaches and Machine Learning
- Probability and Uncertainty
- Support Vector Machines
- More Complicated NNs
- Reinforcement Learning
- Deepblue 1997

## 2005-onwards
- Explosion of applications
- Big Data
- Better Hardware
- Deep Learning
- Deep Reinforcement Learning
- We knew that DL would work back in 1980s 
	Didnâ€™t know how to make it work! 
	Turns out the main bottleneck was data and faster/cheaper computation

## 2014-onwards
- Generative AI
- Creating images and text from input prompts
