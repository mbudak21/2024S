# Constraint Satisfaction Problems
Unlike search problems, CSPs are a type of identification problem, problems in which we must simply identify whether a state is a goal state or not, with no regard to how we arrive at that goal. CSPs are defined by three factors:

1) **Variables:** CSPs possess a set of N variables X1, ..., XN that can each take on a single value from some defined set of values
2) **Domain:** A set {x1, ..., xd } representing all possible values that a CSP variable can take on.
3) **Constraint:** Constraints define restrictions on the values of variables, potentially with regard to other variables.
