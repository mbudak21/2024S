## Deduction | Tümden gelim
**Definition**: Deductive reasoning, or deduction, starts with a general statement or hypothesis and examines the possibilities to reach a specific, logical conclusion. The deductive reasoning process is often summarized by the syllogism, where a conclusion is inferred from two given or assumed propositions (premises).

**Characteristics**:

- Deductive reasoning is used to deduce specific instances from a general law or principle.
- It is considered a logically valid method of reasoning, where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.
- The process is often seen as moving from the general to the specific.

**Example**: If we accept two premises, "All men are mortal" and "Socrates is a man," then we can deduce the conclusion that "Socrates is mortal."

## Induction | Tümevarım
**Definition**: Inductive reasoning, or induction, involves making broad generalizations from specific observations. Essentially, you're making an educated or informed guess based on observed data.

**Characteristics**:

- Inductive reasoning moves from specific observations to broader generalizations and theories.
- It is inherently uncertain; the conclusions reached are probable rather than definitively true or false.
- Inductive reasoning is heavily used in hypothesis formation and theory development in the sciences.

**Example**: After observing that a specific type of apple falls from the tree every time it's ripe, you might generalize that all apples of this type will fall from the tree when they're ripe.
